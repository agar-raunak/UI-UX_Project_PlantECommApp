Pros-
- Lots of information about plants, for all levels of plant parents.
- Pickup and Delivery option Available
- Provide service, e.g. consultation, workshops and photoshop space rental.
- Reviews are present on the plant details page
- Canada wide delivery

Cons-
Under the shop section, information for a plant is not presented
in a user friendly and readable manner. It rather looks like a
lot of text put together.
- Only one pickup location available, making it inaccesible to folks living
further away from the location.
